name_enemy_1 = corpse
descr_enemy_1 = A lifeless body with a sickly smell. It must have been there a long time. A key appears to be sticking out of his jacket pocket.
name_enemy_2 = mutant
descr_enemy_2 = A mutant with a severely disfigured face. Could it be Deadpool?
talk_to_enemy_2 = Are you one of them too?! I won't let you hurt me!
name_enemy_3 = assistant
descr_enemy_3 = He is the assistant to the director, or at least what remains of him, given his significantly enlarged body after the mutations he underwent. He must have helped the director carry out these crazy experiments.
talk_to_enemy_3 = You again? I thought after that hard blow to the head you wouldn't wake up for a while. Well, the next patient is you, so thank you for saving me the trouble of climbing to the full top to get you. Do not resist and get ready to welcome the powers of the virus into your body!
name_enemy_4 = director
descr_enemy_4 = He's the director, as well as the twisted mind behind it all. The signs of the virus seem less evident on him. He will have cunningly waited for as many improvements as possible in tests for the virus before undergoing it himself. Yet he always seemed like a decent man ...
talk_to_enemy_4 = Muahahah! Here you are, agent. After hearing the shots from the cell, I was waiting for you. Are you surprised after discovering my plans? You will be more after seeing the powers you acquire through the virus! Don't take me for a fool, thanks to this virus there will never be weaker people in this world. I will make the human being the most powerful creature that has ever existed on Earth! People will talk about me for millions and millions of years! But if you don't want to help me, don't worry. We need sacrificial victims in honor of the Santa Muerte who supports us in all of this. So, prepare to die!
